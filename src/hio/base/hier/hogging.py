        _nabe (str): action nabe (context) for .act for .nabe property


    As ActBase subclass that is managed inside boxwork, the Hog is created and
    inited by Boxer.make which is run in the enter context of the BoxerDoer.
    So opening file during init is compatible as its in the enter context of the
    its Doer even though its not in the endo context of its box.
    It still needs to be closed. Unlike the hold subery the Boxer doesn't know
    about any Hogs runing as acts inside its boxes so can't close in its BoxerDoer
    exit context. So much be closed inside with a close do act

    Since filed it should reopen without truncating so does not overwrite
    existing log file of same name so uses mode = 'a+'.
    Need to test reopen logic
    Always rewrites header on first log after restart which may have changed
    log behavior so header demarcation enables recognition of log parameters.
    Log header includes rid (unique run id) and datatime stamp so can always
    uniquely match a given run data to header even when reusing same log file.
    This is most important when rotating logs.
    Because each individual log record after header always starts with tyme as
    floating point decimal, processor can find header demarcations interior to
    log file not merely at start.
