hio.core.hier.hiering Module

Provides hierarchical action support




Syntax notes for Mine and Dock use in boxwork:
    M mine (Mine) memory non-durable attribute syntax
    D dock (Dock) durable attribute syntax
    with locally scope variables M ref for mine and D ref for dock.


    so need syntax does not heed to "quote" paths keys into the bags
    containers Mine dict subclasses with attribute support.

    M.root_dog.value  is equivalent to self.mine["root_dog"].value or
                                       self.mine[("root", "dog")].value

    So need term  "M.root_dog.value > 5" should compile directly and eval
    as long as M is in the locals() and M is a Mine instance.

    Likewise for
    D.root_dog.value where D is a Dock and root_dog is a key in the Dock.

    So no need to do substitutions or shorthand
    The hierarchy in the .mine/.dock is indicated by '_' separated keys
    The Box Boxer Actor names are forbidden from having '_" as an element
    with Renam regex test.

    Registers new subclass in ActBase.Registry. Then instantiates cls and returns
    instance.

    Returns:
        instance (cls): instance of new subclass

    Updates the class attributes of new subclass with attrs if any.

    Any callable usually function that is not already a subclass of ActBase can be
    converted to a subclass of ActBase and then registered in the Registry by its
    given name. Usually when defining a class simply make is a subclass of ActBase.
    But when given a function on can decorate it with actify so that a new
    subclass of ActBase is created and registered.

    Usage:
        @actify(name="Tact")
        def test(self, **kwa):  # signature for .act with **iops as **kwa

        t = test(iops=dict(what=1), hello="hello", nabe=Nabe.redo)

    Notes:
    In Python, when a function is assigned as the value of a class attribute,
    the value of that attribute is automagically converted to a bound method of
    that class with injected self as first argument.
