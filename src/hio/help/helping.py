def attributize(genie):
    """
    Decorator function:

    Python generators do not support adding attributes.
    Adding support for attributes provides a way to pass information
    from a WSGI App that returns a generator to a WSGI server via the generator
    after the WSGI app has already started returning its body. The hio.http.Server
    WSGI server looks for the attributes ._status and ._headers and substitutes
    these if present. This allows a streaming WSGI App body iterator to later
    modify the headers and status taht will be returned before the body iterator
    began iterating. This is useful for web hooks or backend requests that are
    serviced by an async coroutine based WSGI app so that they may leverage
    the streaming support of standard WSGI but use a the coroutine based
    hio.http.Server as an async WSGI server.

    This decorator takes a Duck Typing approach to decorating
    a generator function or method that returns a new function type instance that
    when called will return a generator like object that supports attributes.
    the new wrapped object acts like a generator but with attributes.

    Parameters:
        genie (generator function, generator method): is either
            a generator function that returns a generator object
            a generator method that returns a generator object

    If genie is a generator function then a reference to its wrapper
         is injected as the first positional argument to the orginal
         generator function. The convention is to use the parameter 'me' to refer
         to the injected reference to the wrapper.

    If genie is a generator method, that is, its first parameter is 'self'
        then a reference to its wrapper is injected as the second
        positional argument to the original generator method. the convention
        is to use the parameter 'me' to refer to the injected reference to the
        wrapper so as not to collide with the 'self' instance reference.

    When wrapped the new type is AttributiveGenerator

    Usage:
    # decorated generator function
    @attributize
    def bar(me, req=None, rep=None):
        me._status = 400  # or copy from rep.status
        me._headers = odict(example="Hi")  # or copy from rep.headers
        yield b""
        yield b""
        yield b"Hello There"
        return b"Goodbye"

    gen = bar()
    msg = next(gen)  # attributes set after first next
    gen._status
    gen._headers

    # decorated generator method
    class R:
        @attributize
        def bar(self, me, req=None, rep=None):
            self.name = "Peter"
            me._status = 400  # or copy from rep.status
            me._headers = odict(example="Hi")  # or copy from rep.headers
            yield b""
            yield b""
            yield b"Hello There " + self.name.encode()
            return b"Goodbye"

    r = R()
    gen = r.bar()
    msg = next(gen)   # attributes set after first next
    gen._status
    gen._headers

    # use as function wrapper directly instead of as decorator
    def gf(me, x):  # convention injected reference to attributed wrapper is 'me'
        me.x = 5
        me.y = 'a'
        cnt = 0
        while cnt < x:
            yield cnt
            cnt += 1

    agf = attributize(gf)
    ag = agf(3)
    # body of gf is not run until first next call
    assert isIterator(ag)
    assert not hasattr(ag, 'x')
    assert not hasattr(ag, 'y')
    n = next(ag)  # first run here which sets up attributes
    assert n == 0
    assert hasattr(ag, 'x')
    assert hasattr(ag, 'y')
    assert ag.x == 5
    assert ag.y =='a'
    n = next(ag)
    assert n == 1

    Adding attributes to this injected reference makes them available
    as attributes of the resultant wrapper.

    The HTTP WSGI server at hio.core.http.serving.Server uses an instance of
    hio.core.http.serving.Responder to generate the response for each WSGI request.
    The Responder instance checks its WSGI app generator for existence of the
    attributes ._status and ._headers. If so then it overrides its default
    response status with ._status and updates its default response headers
    with the headers in ._header. This allows a backend (webhook) to conveniently
    influence the response status and headers. The response body is returned by
    the generator itself.

    Background:
    Unlike Python functions, Python generators do not support  custom attributes
    and the generator locals dict at .gi_frame.f_locals dissappears once the
    generator is complete so its inconvenient.

    Fixed attributes of generator objects.

        sextets (bytes): first l sextets from front (left) of b as bytes
        (byte string). Length of bytes returned is minimum sufficient to hold
        all l sextets. Last byte returned is right bit padded with zeros which
        is compatible with mid padded codes on front of primitives

    Parameters:
        b (bytes | str): target from which to nab sextets
        l (int): number of sextets to nab from front of b
